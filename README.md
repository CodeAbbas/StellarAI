## ðŸš€ Getting Started & Deployment

This project is optimized for deployment on **Vercel**.

### **Step 1: Set Up Your GitHub Repository**

1.  Create a new **private** repository on GitHub.
2.  Add the files from this project (`index.html`, `app.js`, etc.) to the repository.

### **Step 2: Deploy on Vercel**

1.  Sign up for a Vercel account and connect it to your GitHub.
2.  Import your new GitHub repository into Vercel. Vercel will automatically detect the project settings.
3.  **Crucially, set up the Environment Variable** to protect your API key:
    -   In your Vercel project settings, go to **Settings > Environment Variables**.
    -   Create a new variable with the name `HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY`.
    -   Paste your actual Hugging Face API key (e.g., `hf_...`) into the value field.
    -   Click **Save**.
4.  Deploy your project. Vercel will give you a domain, and you can add a custom one later in the project settings.
